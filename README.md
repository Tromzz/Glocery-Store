I endeavored to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into this project, which proved to be a stimulating experience for me. üèÜ \
The integration of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) was particularly impressive.
Furthermore, I employed an intriguing tool called [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and shared my insights on it via my LinkedIn profile. Utilizing Strapi in this context was truly enriching, and I wish them continued success. Additionally, [Shadcn](https://shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components and [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/)   were utilized in the development of this project.

Now you can see [Demo](https://online-grocery-store-web.vercel.app/)\
Thank you very much. üôè
